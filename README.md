# Citibank-Tansportation-App

PC021- (Citi) How might we provide clear, concise, real-time transportation recommendations, with a goal of of a single unified payment system for all modes?

CitiGo is a transportation product that aims to make NYC subway travel painless and convenient through real-time notifications and seamless payment integration. It mainly consists of two features:

1. Notification 

Our notification engine is continually getting the most updated data about service change and delays from MTA website. It contains an artificial intelligent parser which turns the complicated, hard-to-read messages to easier and human readable notifications. It is not only used when users search for new routes on our app but also used when it learns user transit behavior, monitor your trips and push notification to you passively.

2. Payment 

This is a function designed for the future use. MTA is about to change its terminal payment system. We are targeting this market change by integrating payment solution to our transit app. People will be able to pay for their trips through our app. We may also offer bundling discount price, subscription services, where people can better monitor their monthly/annual transit plan and refill easily.
